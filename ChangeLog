 - Added Lynx3d's patch for triggering of FoF/Frostbite
 - Added remove movement imparing effects for Warbringer
 - Added Sudden death "at least X rage left" from fullburned suggestion(Sorry, I cant add author name because getmangos.org is down)
 - Removed hardcoded packet from SpellAuras.cpp, but in Player.cpp i still need it

 - Sorry, I dont know exact changes :(
 
=== Glyph of Corruption - in 8559 === 
Simple fix, just add one "case" - this glyph has same effect as Nightfall
